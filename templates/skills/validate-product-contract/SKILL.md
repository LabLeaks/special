# Validate Product Contract

Use this skill when you need to judge whether a live product claim is honestly supported.

1. Start from one exact claim, not a whole subtree.
2. Run `special spec SPEC.ID --verbose` and read the claim text before reading the attached support.
3. Review each attached `@verifies` or `@attests` body and decide whether it proves the exact claim rather than a nearby one.
4. If the verify hides the important setup behind helpers, treat that as a quality problem and tighten it.
5. If the claim is not actually ready to ship, move it back to `@planned` instead of pretending the support is good enough.
6. Run `special lint` if the support looks malformed or the references seem inconsistent.
